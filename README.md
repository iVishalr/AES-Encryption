# AES-Encryption

### Description

This is a simple implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard using C Programming Language

This is a quick and simple AES Encryption implementation using C Programming Language The below code takes in a Base64 encoded string(message) and and Base64 encoded Key from the user and encrypts it according to AES algorithms and standards. As of now only 128 - bit level encryption is supported.

THIS IMPLEMENTATION MUST NOT BE USED TO ENCRYPT AND DECRYPT TEXT,FILES OR ANYTHING AS IT IS VULNERABLE TO CACHE ATTACKS AND MANY OTHER ATTACKS AND HE OR SHE WHO IS ATTACKING CAN READ THE BYTES SUBSTITUTED FROM S_BOX BY TIMING THEIR ATTACK WHILE THE ENCRYPTION IS TAKING PLACE.
